								<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
								<p>I have always had an interest in IT since I was young trying to figure out how my computer worked, honestly it’s a bit stupid it took me this long to figure out I should study and make a career out of that interest. My background in IT is very minimal, mostly base level computer building ect.  I’m a video editor and studio operator by day for a news broadcaster so I deal with complex IT systems everyday but mostly just press buttons and pray it already works. News broadcast as it stands is in my opinion dying and not going to get me anywhere I want to go so I enrolled in order to change up my career.  Cloud computing interests me currently as it is in use within our regional news studio at work and while the little cloud computing we use works for what we need I believe it could facilitate a lot more for us and others.</p>
								<h4>Why I chose RMIT</h4>
								<p>I chose to study with RMIT through OUA as I was able to fit my studies around my full time work hours. I also believed RMIT would be the best university for me to acquire the knowledge and skills for me to change careers in the future. </p>
								<h5>What I expect to Learn</h5>
								<p> Aside from learning programming, data systems, computing, and just listening off the subjects I will be taking throughout this degree, I expect to gain a better understanding of many of the different faculties that are encompassed by I.T. I hope to learn and understand where I will fit into the world of I.T in the near future what my interests will be and what areas I will further explore as a career in my future. </p>

								<h4>Skills qualification and experience required</h4>
								<p>This position requires experience in various cybersecurity frameworks, developing designs, understanding of various cyber security specific risks and requirements and requires being able to present ideas and advice to teams in order for projects to be completed.</p>
								<h5>Current skills and qualifications</h5>
								<p>I really have no relevant skills and qualifications at this moment in relation to this position. My current skill set includes video editing and content producing which may be seen as desirable in the context of being able to work to deadlines and under stress.</p>
								<h6>Plan to Obtain skills</h6>
								<p>Obviously continuing to study  is a must if I want to work in this field, I may also take on a diploma in cyber security to further my knowledge.

								<h5>Hogan Pesonality Inventory</h5>
								<p>Stability (HPI: Adjustment). Your score 6 of 10. Reflects the degree to which a person is calm or moody and volatile. High scorers seem confident, resilient, and optimistic, calm, steady under pressure, resistant to feedback .

Low scorers are less interested in format education and more interested in hand-on learning on the job; focused on their interest, technology averse.</p>
								<h6>Result Analysis</h6>
								<p>These results mostly confirm what I already Know about myself particularly the myers-briggs and VARK learning tests. The HPI test has the most important results to me in an aspect of what a potential employer might want me to explain about myself in an interview setting. When forming a team I would take into account my “mediator” personality and my hpi leadership score showing me more comfortable taking a following role rather than trying to lead my group and not being comfortable doing so, however I do believe pushing myself to be comfortable leading a team would be beneficial to my professional development.</p>

								<h2 class="major">FlickDeck</h2> 
								<h2>overview</h2>
								<p>FlickDeck is an app developed to streamline decisions of what content on various streaming platforms to consume by linking user accounts in order to create a shared list of “liked” content chosen in a swipe left or right method made popular by applications such as tinder.</p>
								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>Content streaming services have become the new norm for most households preferred method of entertainment, in Australia alone Netflix has 11.9 million subscribers and when it comes to deciding what to watch and 2016 american
								<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/netflix-users-waste-ton-of-time-searching-for-something-to-watch">study</a> found that on average users spend 17.8 minutes browsing netflix before choosing something to watch, and that 40 percent of users wanted to watch something different to their partner or spouse.
								 While curator and aggregator apps such as reelgood and dinggo, (of which are unavailable to the australian market at this stage) exist they do not focus on issue of partners not agreeing on something to watch where as FlickDeck’s specific purpose is to curate a list for a selected linked user group for consumption.</p>
								<h4>Description</h4>
								<p>FlickDeck could crudely be summed up as “Tinder for movies” in which users will be shown the poster/title card for a movie or show and the user is prompted to either swipe right if they are interested in the content or left if they are not interested. The main function of the app is that Users will link their account with another user account, for example a partner or spouse, both of the users with linked accounts will be shown the same content on their separate devices. when users have both swiped right the selected piece of content will be added to a list that the users have access to and they will be alerted to the match. The content the app displays will be taken from a database of content that is available on selected streaming services (netflix, amazon, stan ect.) that the users will indicate they have access to when creating an account. The overall functionality and user experience within the app itself is purposely simple in an effort to have a streamlined decision process when users sit down to enjoy content, the users simply load up their lists of shared interests to select from rather than browsing for extended periods. There is also the possibility of having accounts linked to users streaming service accounts so that when a match is made it can be added to users' watch queues within the streaming service applications themselves. Streaming service account linking is however not a concern within the first iteration of this project.</p>
								<h5>Tools and technologies</h5>
								<p>To develop this project there is an obvious need for app development programs and coding such apps as swing2app could be used or with more coding and customisable interfaces ionic framework or phonegap could be used. Some sort of database repository should be used to collect and store the data and images of content available on streaming services; this would mostly need to be cloud based as it must be accessed not only by the application but also be accessed to be edited when content is either added or removed from services.</p>
								<h6>Skills required</h6>
								<p>A proficient skill set in coding will most likely be needed in this project as well as design skills when it comes to the user interface of the program this could be mocked up in proto.io and further transferred through to adobe applications to be worked upon further. A team that has experience in not only developing but maintaining an online operating service would be beneficial to the project.</p>
								<h6>Outcome</h6>
								<p>If the project is successful it is reasonable to assume that on average more content will be consumed on a whole and that users of streaming services particularly those in households that watch content together will have a more enjoyable experience. Further into the future it is possible that the concept and execution of this application could be fully integrated into streaming services as they strive to provide a better user experience for their customers. </p>
